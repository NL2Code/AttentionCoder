The cost matrix `cost` should be a 2D list with `m+1` rows and `n+1` columns. The position `(m, n)` should be within the range of the cost matrix.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\ncost = [\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 8, 2],\n    [1, 5, 3]\n]\n\nm = 2\nn = 2\n\nprint(\"Minimum cost to reach ({}, {}) from (0, 0) is: {}\".format(m, n, min_cost_path(cost, m, n)))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nMinimum cost to reach (2, 2) from (0, 0) is: 8\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost path from (0, 0) to (m, n) by considering subproblems and storing their solutions in the `min_cost_matrix`. The time complexity of this function is O(m*n), where m and n are the dimensions of the cost matrix."}

It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if any number divides it evenly. If a divisor is found, it returns `False`, otherwise, it returns `True`.\n\nThen, we define the main function `get_non_prime_numbers()` which takes a range of numbers (start and end) and finds all the non-prime numbers within that range. It iterates through each number in the range and uses the `is_prime()` function to determine if it is a non-prime number. If it is non-prime, it appends it to a list of non-prime numbers.\n\nYou can use this code by calling the `get_non_prime_numbers()` function with the desired range of numbers. For example,\n\n```python\nnon_prime_nums = get_non_prime_numbers(1, 100)\nprint(non_prime_nums)\n```\n\nThis will return a list of non-prime numbers between 1 and 100."}

We can observe that if we have a filled 3 x (i-2) board, we can add two vertical dominos to get a filled 3 x i board. Additionally, if we have a filled 3 x (i-4) board, we can add two horizontal dominos and one vertical domino in the middle to get a filled 3 x i board. \n\nUsing this observation, we can fill the dp array using the recurrence relation: `dp[i] = dp[i-2] * 4 - dp[i-4]`.\n\nFinally, we return `dp[n]` as the number of ways to fill the 3 x n board with 2 x 1 dominoes.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the given n is a positive integer."}

This is done to handle rotations that wrap around the end of the string.\n- Then, it iterates over integers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the original string `s`).\n- For each iteration, it checks if the substring of length `n` starting from the current index `i` is equal to the original string `s`.\n- If a match is found, the function returns the rotation count `i`.\n- If no match is found, it means that the given string is already the same after rotating `n` times, so the function returns `n`."}

On each iteration, we add `n - i` to the `sum` and increment `i` by 2 (to get the next number in the sequence).\n4. After the loop ends, we return the calculated sum.\n\nYou can call this function with different values of `n` to calculate the sum of the positive integers in the sequence.

If the square root is an integer, then the number is itself a perfect square, and can be represented as the product of two identical squares.\n\nIf the square root is not an integer, the function iterates through each integer less than or equal to the square root. For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` divides the number evenly. If it does, it further checks if both `i` and `number/i` are perfect squares. If both conditions are satisfied, then the number can be represented as the product of two squares.\n\nIf none of the conditions are met, the function returns False.\n\nHope this helps!

The function takes in two parameters, `arr` which is the sorted array of values and `target` which is the value we want to locate the left insertion point for.\n2. We initialize the `left` variable as 0 (the start index) and `right` variable as the length of the array.\n3. We use a while loop to iterate until `left` is no longer less than `right`.\n4. Inside the loop, we calculate the `middle` index as the floor division of the sum of `left` and `right` by 2.\n5. If the value at the `middle` index is less than the `target`, it means the `target` should be inserted to the right of `middle`, so we update `left` to `middle + 1`.\n6. Otherwise, if the value at the `middle` index is greater than or equal to the `target`, it means the `target` should be inserted to the left of `middle` or at `middle` itself, so we update `right` to `middle`.\n7. Finally, we return the value of `left` as the left insertion point for the `target`.\n\nNote: This function assumes that `arr` is already sorted in ascending order.

The `find_cheapest_items` function takes in a `dataset` (list of dictionaries) and an integer `n` representing the number of cheapest price items to find.\n3. We create an empty min-heap, represented by the `min_heap` list.\n4. We iterate through the dataset and push each item into the min-heap using `heapq.heappush`, with the item's price as the key and the item itself as the value. By default, `heapq.heappush` will heapify the min-heap after each insertion.\n5. We create an empty list `cheapest_items` to store the n cheapest price items.\n6. We use a for loop to extract the n smallest items from the min-heap. We do this by using `heapq.heappop` to pop the smallest item (based on its price) from the min-heap. We append the extracted item to the `cheapest_items` list.\n7. Finally, we return the `cheapest_items`.\n\nYou can use this function by passing in your dataset and the desired number of cheapest items to find.

Finally, it converts the rotated binary string back to an integer using the `int()` function and returns the result.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nnum = 10\nrotate = 2\nrotated_num = left_rotate_bits(num, rotate)\nprint(rotated_num)  # Output: 40\n```\n\nIn this example, the binary representation of `10` is `00000000000000000000000000001010`. After left rotating the bits by 2 positions, the new binary representation is `00000000000000000000000000101000`, which is equivalent to the integer `40`."}

The function returns a new list containing the elements from `lst` at the specified indices.\n\nBefore accessing the elements, the function performs a couple of input validations.

The function takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns `None` as an invalid input.\n3. A variable `smallest_multiple` is initialized to 1, as the smallest multiple of any number is 1.\n4. The function then loops through the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.\n5. Inside the loop, the function calculates the greatest common divisor of the current number (`i`) and the current `smallest_multiple` using the `math.gcd()` function.\n6. The `smallest_multiple` is then updated by multiplying it with `i` divided by the greatest common divisor, which ensures that the new `smallest_multiple` is the smallest common multiple of the first `i` numbers.\n7. After the loop completes, the function returns the final `smallest_multiple`.\n\nThis function makes use of the mathematical property that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` can be calculated as `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.

The function `find_sequences` takes a string as input.\n2. The regular expression pattern `'[A-Z][a-z]+'` matches one upper case letter (`[A-Z]`) followed by one or more lower case letters (`[a-z]+`).\n3. The `re.findall` function finds all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the input string and returns them as a list.\n4. The function returns the list of matched sequences.\n   \nIn the example usage, the input string is `'HelloWorld TestingSequence abcDEFghi'`. The function will find two sequences: `'Hello'` and `'TestingSequence'`, as they both match the pattern.\n\nNote: If you want to find sequences that are only enclosed within the string and not part of a longer word, you can modify the pattern to include word boundary anchors (`\\b`). For example, the pattern would be changed to `r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b'`."}

The function returns the number of ways to tile the area of length `n` using tiles of length 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe base cases are when `n` is 0, in which case there is only one way to tile the area (with an empty tile), and when `n` is negative, which means it's impossible to tile the area. In these cases, the function immediately returns the corresponding result.\n\nFor larger values of `n`, the function makes recursive calls to count the number of ways to tile the remaining area after placing a tile of length 1, 2, or 3. The results of these recursive calls are summed up and returned as the final result.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```python\ntotal_length = 5\nnum_ways = count_tilings(total_length)\nprint(f\"The number of ways to tile an area of length {total_length} is {num_ways}.\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nThe number of ways to tile an area of length 5 is 13.\n```\n\nNote that this simple recursive solution has an exponential time complexity and may not be efficient for large values of `n`. There are more efficient algorithms to solve the tiling problem, such as using dynamic programming techniques."}
